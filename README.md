Notes to Grader:
Referred to the videos provided for help with all the steps and requirements and code online in the textbook, as well as ChatGPT to complete assignment. 


World is created based around the cat, desigend to be in space with floating objetcs for the cat to enjoy. It was created with various textures, as well as a game implemented to score points based on doing different things. Camera movement and angles are fully implemented, as well as key commands. Uers are also able to add and delete blocks, with the wow factor being the game implemented with the story and different textures shown in the game.
